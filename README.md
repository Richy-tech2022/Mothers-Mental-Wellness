Mamastrong is a compassionate and insightful machine learning web app built using Streamlit to help postpartum mothers assess their mental health risk. By answering a short set of questions about daily habits and stressors, mothers receive a prediction of whether they are currently at low or high mental health risk. The tool aims to raise early awareness and promote wellness-seeking behavior.
